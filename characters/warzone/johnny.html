                 </div>
                <p> Despite making no physical appearance in the campaign, he is mentioned by John Price in the game's ending cutscene as one of the few names up for consideration for the newly assembled Task Force 141.<br> 
<br>
In the cutscene for the intel mission "The War Room", he is heard communicating to Price, who had just killed Victor Zakhaev and stopped the nuke detonation, requesting backup as things at his position are â€œheating up". Price asks him to hold tight as he and his team jump off the dam and head towards the war-torn Verdansk.

<br>
Sergeant Johnny MacTavish, also known as Soap, is a character featured in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II. Soap is mentioned at the end of the Modern Warfare campaign and heard within a Call of Duty: Warzone cutscene.
