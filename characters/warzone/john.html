                <h2>John Price</h2>
                 </div>
                <p> With his service in the 22nd SAS Regiment, John Price has spent most of his career fighting in the shadows. He's been shot, captured, abandoned, blown up, locked up, tortured, and left for dead. Price is a veteran of military operations in nearly every conflict-prone corner of the world, distinguishing himself with acts of gallantry and intrepidity. His achievements have risen to the stuff of regimental history. <br> 
<br>
Price joined the infantry at the age of 16 and has served in the British Army for 18 years. One of the youngest cadets to ever graduate the Royal Military Academy as a commissioned officer, he completed Special Service Commando selection and was 'badged' a member of the SAS, proving his worth on countless covert operations over multiple deployments in the Middle East. Promoted to Captain in 2011, callsign 'Bravo Six', Price is the officer in charge of a highly effective unit, tasked with anti–hijacking counter–terrorism, specializing in close quarter combat, sniper techniques and hostage rescue. 
<br>
<br>
He is unofficially missioned to capture or kill high-value targets. Blessed with uncanny instincts and an unchecked determination, Captain Price is a peerless combat-tracker, known for exceling in a fluid and volatile environment. An elite seek-and-strike expert, Price is versed in a wide range of fieldcraft and tactical capability. From airborne shock-trooper to long-range reconnaissance operator, Captain Price is a covert, jungle, desert and urban operator, sniper and saboteur.
<br>
<br>
With a knack for developing and maintaining links to foreign fighters across the globe by earning goodwill through trust, Captain Price works closely with Western Intelligence agencies assigned to aggressively pursue HVTs. His counter-terrorism squadron is on call to mobilize anywhere in Europe with immediate readiness.
<br>
<br>
Price believes that the duty of every soldier is to fight for the greater good— "The rules of engagement don't change, but their justification does." Price always fights for what's right but he knows what's right isn't always what you're fighting for. He's often said, "One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter." Sometimes unpredictable and unrestrained, John Price has a golden rule all his own: "We get dirty, and the world stays clean."
